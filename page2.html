    <p>
      Joker was created by Bill Finger, Bob Kane, and Jerry Robinson. Joker's debut issue was in the comic Batman #1 (April 25, 1940).
      Joker has been apart of many defining stories. Such as, murdering Jason Todd (The second Robin) in Batman: A Death in the Family and paralysis Barbara Gordon in Batman: The Killing Joke.
      Joker uses party gags as weapons. Razor playing cards, joy buzzers, explosive chattering teeth, acid spraying flowers, and a handgun loaded with bullets and a toy flag.
      He even has his own toxin that causes the victim to laugh to death and streches their face with a smile.
      In the 1990's, Joker persuaded a psychiatrist at Arkham Asylum named Harleen Quinzel to join him and look at the world as he sees it. She is now Joker's sidekick and romantic partner Harley Quinn.
