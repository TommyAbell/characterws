<h1>Joker</h1>
<p>
  The Joker's real backstory is unknown. "If i'm going to have a past I prefer it to be multiple choice!"
  The most iconic backstory is from the graphic novel Batman: The Killing Joke.
  Published in March 1988 and written by Alan Moore and illustrated by Brian Bolland.
  He was a failed comedian. Desperate to support his pregnant wife, he agrees to guide two criminals through the chemical plant he used to work at so they can rob the playing card company next to it.
  During the planning, he is told by police that his wife and unborn child have died in a electrocution accident at his home.
  With deep sorrow, he wants to backout of the robbery plan but is forced not to. The two criminals make him wear a Red Hood.
  They encounter security and the two criminals are killed by gunfire. Batman comes to investigate. To escape he jumps into the chemical plant's waste pound lock and is swept through a pipe leading outside.
  He discovers he has chalk white skin, blood red lips, and bright green hair. "All it takes is one bad day to reduce the sanest man alive to lunacy."
  Joker is now obsessed with Batman because he is proof that you can survive "One bad day." One of Joker's goals is to drive Batman mad and get him to kill.
  In this graphic novel, Joker shoots and paralyzes Barbara Gordon to drive her father Commissioner James Gordon insane. He does this to prove that it takes only "One bad day."
